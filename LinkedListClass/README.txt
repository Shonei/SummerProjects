Here I plan to create a linked list class that will use the template to create 
the structure of the linked list when the user creates the linkedListObject.

I would make it a double linked list for more options. 
I would add some methods that should work with most basic types of variables. 

i am planning on adding the methods:

addLast - add a node at the end of the list 
addFirst - add a node at the begining
addBefore - adds a node before a given node
addAfter - adds a node after a given node
deleteNode - remove a given node
createNode - will be static and will return an individual node
listLength - returns the length of the list
