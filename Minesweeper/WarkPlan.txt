I will be using inheritance to re use the rectngle and game class from 
my  SFML project. There is hardly any benefit to me doing that. however i want
to have some more practice with inheritance before I actualy do bigger 
projects for school or work.

After some more thpught I decided to not use inheritance as there will
be no benefit so i am making everything from scratch. 
At this point I have a Block class that will repesent all the mines in
the game. 
It still needs to be tested.
